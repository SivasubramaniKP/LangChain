adhukum check pannanum
Distance between 1 to 4 is -1
Distance between 4 to 1 is -1
So take min(0, -1+-1) = -2
23/03/25, 9:44 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: indha graph la negative cycle irukka naala, A oda self distance(A, A) -2 nu solranga i.e., (A -> B -> C -> D -> A)
23/03/25, 9:45 pm - Sivasu: idha engayo paatha maari irukku!
23/03/25, 9:45 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Does this mean we need to check distance for vertices to themselves in negative cycle graph?
23/03/25, 9:45 pm - Sivasu: yeSSS
23/03/25, 9:45 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Explain yourself 🗡️
23/03/25, 9:45 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Okay

23/03/25, 9:46 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Yeahh. Paathappovaee light ah thonuchu.
23/03/25, 9:46 pm - Sivasu: if u include D i.e., while computing 4th matrix
23/03/25, 9:47 pm - Sivasu: u could go from A to A through D (Following the path a-b-c-d-a)
23/03/25, 9:48 pm - Sivasu: u could go from a to d (a-b-c-d), the cost is 1 + -1 + -1 = -1
23/03/25, 9:48 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: So through d is the efficient way
23/03/25, 9:49 pm - Sivasu: u could from d to a ( through direct edge ) -1

take min(0, -1 + -1)
0 means stay at A itself 
-2 means go to a-b-c-d-a to reduce the cost <This message was edited>
23/03/25, 9:49 pm - Sivasu: exactly
To reduce the cost

---

💡 Use Case:

Allow users to sign up and post questions.


---

1. Database Schema (stackoverflow_db)

CREATE DATABASE stackoverflow_db;

USE stackoverflow_db;

CREATE TABLE users (
    username VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    password VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    fullname VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE questions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    question_title VARCHAR(255),
    question_body TEXT,
    posted_on TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES users(username)
);


---

2. JDBC Connectivity (DatabaseConnect.java)

package SqlConnect;
import java.sql.*;

public class DatabaseConnect {
    public Connection Connect() throws SQLException, ClassNotFoundException {
        Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
        Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(
            "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stackoverflow_db", "root", "yourPassword");
        System.out.println("Connected to StackOverflow DB");
        return con;
    }
}


---

3. Insert User (Register.java)

@WebServlet("/Register")
public class Register extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
        String username = request.getParameter("username");
        String password = request.getParameter("password");
        String email = request.getParameter("email");
        String fullname = request.getParameter("fullname");

        try {
            Connection con = new DatabaseConnect().Connect();
            PreparedStatement pst = con.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)");
            pst.setString(1, username);
            pst.setString(2, password);
            pst.setString(3, email);
            pst.setString(4, fullname);
            pst.executeUpdate();
            con.close();

            response.getWriter().println("User registered successfully!");
        } catch(Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


---

4. Insert Question (AskQuestion.java)

@WebServlet("/AskQuestion")
public class AskQuestion extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
        String username = request.getParameter("username");
        String title = request.getParameter("title");
        String body = request.getParameter("body");

        try {
            Connection con = new DatabaseConnect().Connect();
            PreparedStatement pst = con.prepareStatement(
                "INSERT INTO questions (username, question_title, question_body) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
            pst.setString(1, username);
            pst.setString(2, title);
            pst.setString(3, body);
            pst.executeUpdate();
            con.close();

            response.getWriter().println("Question posted successfully!");
        } catch(Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


---

5. HTML Sign-Up Form (register.html)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Sign Up - StackOverflow</title></head>
<body>
<h2>StackOverflow Registration</h2>
<form action="Register" method="post">
    Full Name: <input type="text" name="fullname"><br><br>
    Email: <input type="email" name="email"><br><br>
    Username: <input type="text" name="username"><br><br>
    Password: <input type="password" name="password"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Register">
</form>
</body>
</html>


---

6. HTML Question Form (ask.html)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Ask a Question</title></head>
<body>
<h2>Ask a Question on StackOverflow</h2>
<form action="AskQuestion" method="post">
    Username: <input type="text" name="username"><br><br>
    Title: <input type="text" name="title"><br><br>
    Body: <textarea name="body" rows="6" cols="50"></textarea><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Post Question">
</form>
</body>
</html>

Let me know if you'd like:

JSP version instead of plain HTML

Login functionality

Display list of questions page

CSS style or Bootstrap integration

Tomcat server configuration


I can help extend this project into a fully functional Q&A platform if you'd like!
08/04/25, 9:19 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Here are definitions and explanations related to the StackOverflow-style web application you’re building using Java Servlets, JDBC, and MySQL:


---

🔑 Key Concepts and Definitions

1. Web Application

A web application is software that runs on a web server and is accessed via a browser. It typically uses:

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (user interface)

Backend: Java, PHP, Python, etc. (logic + database communication)

Database: Stores user and app data (MySQL, Oracle, etc.)



---

2. Servlet

A Servlet is a Java class used to handle HTTP requests and generate responses, typically HTML pages.

doGet() – handles GET requests.

doPost() – handles POST requests (like form submissions).



---

3. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

JDBC is a Java API used to connect and execute queries with databases.

DriverManager is used to get a connection.

PreparedStatement is used to execute SQL safely and efficiently.



---

4. Connection

A Connection object in JDBC represents a session with the database. It is used to:

Execute SQL queries.

Manage transactions.



---

5. Database

A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. In your case:

MySQL is the RDBMS used.

You create tables for users and questions.



---

6. Form (HTML)

An HTML form collects user input. It sends data to a server via:

method="get" or method="post"

action="Register" sends data to a servlet with URL mapping /Register.



---

7. Servlet Mapping

This defines the URL that maps to a specific servlet. Example:

@WebServlet("/Register")
public class Register extends HttpServlet { ... }

When the user accesses /Register, this servlet is triggered.


---

8. Primary Key

A unique identifier for a record in a table. Example: username in the users table.


---

9. Foreign Key

A column that refers to the primary key of another table. Example: username in the questions table refers to username in the users table.


---

10. SQL Statements

INSERT INTO – Adds new data to a table.

SELECT – Retrieves data.

CREATE TABLE – Defines a new table in the database.



---

11. Request and Response

In servlets:

HttpServletRequest – Retrieves form data (getParameter()).

HttpServletResponse – Sends back a result to the browser.



---

12. Validation (Frontend)

JavaScript can be used to validate form data before it’s submitted to the server to avoid incomplete or incorrect inputs.


---

10/04/25, 7:13 pm - Sivasu: BREAKING SEO news - Google is issuing manual actions for sites

- which host too much thin content and
- that content is totally different from the site's primary topic

So far I have identified few domains which are impacted and Google has removed parts of those from their search results.

And there is this one publication, GeeksforGeeks, their whole domain is removed from Google Search because of manual action. Per numbers from Semrush, GeeksforGeeks gets almost 70 million monthly traffic from Google Search BUT now it's gone totally.

Their primary topic is programming tutorials but over last year they have gone too broad and were writing about topics which aren't related to programming at all.

On another note ☝️
Over the years SEO Community has been complaining to Google about this practice being leveraged by large publishers and they trying to rank for everything with thin content, this has specifically been a big challenge for SEOs working with SMBs.

Ex 4 B.docx
14/04/25, 7:01 am - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: In the context of Falcon or cryptographic applications, ACB (Arithmetical Complex Basis) is sometimes considered as an alternative to FFT for lattice-based operations. Here are some advantages of ACB over FFT:


---

1. Better Numerical Stability:

ACB uses fixed-point arithmetic or exact arithmetic with integers instead of floating-point (like FFT).

This greatly reduces rounding errors and makes ACB more precise—a huge benefit in cryptography where precision is critical.



---

2. Resistance to Side-Channel Attacks:

Since ACB avoids floating-point operations, it can be made constant-time more easily, helping protect against timing and power analysis attacks.

FFT's floating-point ops can leak subtle info; ACB is more secure in this regard.



---

3. Simpler to Audit for Correctness:

Integer-based arithmetic in ACB is usually easier to verify and audit than the complex and error-prone floating-point math used in FFT.



---

4. Deterministic Behavior:

ACB operations are deterministic (same result every time) unlike FFT, which might produce slightly different results due to floating-point rounding.

This is important for reproducibility and signature validation.



---

5. Easier to Implement on Constrained Devices:

ACB can be more efficient for small-scale or embedded systems where floating-point units are limited or unavailable.
14/04/25, 7:01 am - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: We need to show the above advantages using either.a graph or table
14/04/25, 7:01 am - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Think of how to project those advantages in results section
14/04/25, 9:07 am - Sivasu: Did mam send this?
14/04/25, 9:09 am - Sivasu: One correction
14/04/25, 9:10 am - Sivasu: We are using Acceptance complement Sampling
14/04/25, 9:10 am - Sivasu: I accidently called it ACB
14/04/25, 9:30 am - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Okay what should I do with this now
14/04/25, 9:41 am - Sivasu: Did mam send this?
14/04/25, 9:41 am - Sivasu: She searched ACB and it gave result for something else
14/04/25, 9:51 am - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: T yes ma'am sent this dude
14/04/25, 9:57 am - Sivasu: Ok
14/04/25, 9:58 am - Sivasu: What should we do now
14/04/25, 9:58 am - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: I sent this to ma'am
14/04/25, 9:58 am - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Ma'am one correction. We accidentally called Acceptance complement Sampling as ACB.
14/04/25, 9:58 am - Sivasu: Ok
14/04/25, 3:16 pm - Sivasu: Say when ur free 
we should do something for vnstat

14/04/25, 3:19 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Shit.
14/04/25, 3:19 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: I guess that might be because you went through falcon
14/04/25, 3:19 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: 🫢
14/04/25, 3:20 pm - Sivasu: 🤓
ig so
14/04/25, 3:20 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Okay let's put it in the group now
14/04/25, 3:21 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Or can we just work on it.
14/04/25, 3:21 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Just 2 of us
14/04/25, 3:21 pm - Sivasu: Yeah 2 is enough
14/04/25, 3:21 pm - Sivasu: there is no work for 7 ppls
14/04/25, 3:22 pm - Sivasu: tell somebody to make some ppt on vnstat
14/04/25, 3:22 pm - Sivasu: lets do the recording and the stuff

15/04/25, 10:02 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Absolutely! Here's a concise write-up including definitions and a few sample queries you can use directly in your lab record or project documentation.

---

## 🔑 Key Definitions:

### 1. **NoSQL Database**  
NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a non-relational database model that stores and retrieves data in formats like documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs. It is highly scalable and ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

### 2. **MongoDB**  
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Each record is a document with key-value pairs.

### 3. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**  
These commands define the structure of the database, such as creating collections (equivalent to tables in RDBMS).

> 📌 Example:
```js
db.createCollection("users");
```

### 4. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**  
These commands are used to insert, update, or delete the data in collections.

> 📌 Example:
```js
db.users.insertOne({
  uid: 1,
  username: "codeMaster99",
  email: "codemaster99@example.com",
  reputation: 1200
});
```

### 5. **DQL (Data Query Language)**  
These commands retrieve data from the database using queries, often with filters and projections.

> 📌 Example:
```js
db.questions.find({ tags: "javascript" });
```

### 6. **Aggregation**  
Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results, such as counts, averages, or groupings.

> 📌 Example:
```js
db.questions.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$uid", totalQuestions: { $sum: 1 } } }
]);
```

---

## 🧪 Example Queries for Practice:

```js
// Create a collection
db.createCollection("answers");

// Insert a document
db.answers.insertOne({
  aid: 201,
  qid: 101,
  uid: 2,
  content: "Use async/await to simplify promise handling.",
  answeredOn: new Date("2024-01-12"),
  upvotes: 11
});

// Retrieve all questions
db.questions.find({});

// Update user reputation
db.users.updateOne({ uid: 1 }, { $set: { reputation: 1300 } });

// Delete a comment
db.comments.deleteOne({ cid: 301 });
```

18/04/25, 5:11 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: https://chatgpt.com/c/67fe66a6-2028-800e-8cd7-35967ea985ca
18/04/25, 5:11 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Absolutely — here’s a breakdown showing **how Falcon performs** on your five criteria, **citing specific findings from the document** so you can argue where your algorithm shines.

---

## ✅ 1. **Better Numerical Stability**

### Falcon:
- **Relies on floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754 doubles)** with 53-bit precision【Page 53】.
- Uses **FFT-domain operations**, making it sensitive to **rounding errors** and **numeric drift**【Page 32】.
- Complex normalization steps (e.g., for LDL\* trees) depend on precise float handling【Page 32–33】.

### If your algorithm:
- Uses **only integers** or **fixed-point arithmetic**,
- Avoids FFTs,
- You can claim **superior numerical stability**, especially across hardware with varying float behavior.

---

## ✅ 2. **Resistance to Side-Channel Attacks**

### Falcon:
- Original implementation was **vulnerable** to side-channel attacks【Page 20】.
- Modern versions are **constant-time**, but **masking is still difficult**.
- Heavy use of **FFT + float ops** = more exploitable leakage vectors【Page 53】.

### If your algorithm:
- Is inherently constant-time,
- Avoids floating-point or complex memory access patterns,
- Implements lightweight or **natural masking**,
You can confidently claim better **side-channel resistance**.

---

## ✅ 3. **Simpler to Audit for Correctness**

### Falcon:
- Uses **recursive tree structures**, FFTs, and LDL\* decompositions【Pages 32–33】.
- Key generation requires **precision floating-point math** and **multi-layered complexity**.
- Even the authors admit Falcon is **hard to audit**【Page 20】.

### If your algorithm:
- Has linear or flat control flow,
- Uses simple mathematical primitives,
- Doesn’t require floating-point checks or recursion,
Then it's **much easier to verify formally or manually**, making it safer in critical systems.

---

## ✅ 4. **Deterministic Behavior**

### Falcon:
- Not deterministic due to:
  - **Floating-point round-off** effects,
  - **Sampling-based signature generation** (needs Gaussian noise),
  - Performance varies with compiler, flags, and CPU (e.g., AVX2 use)【Page 62】.

### If your algorithm:
- Uses **fixed or pre-seeded deterministic logic**,
- Avoids probabilistic sampling for signing,
- Then you offer a clear **predictable and repeatable execution model**—ideal for security-critical environments.

---

## ✅ 5. **Easier to Implement on Constrained Devices**

### Falcon:
- Uses:
  - 64-bit **floating point** operations,
  - **AVX2/FMA instruction sets**【Page 62】,
  - **Large polynomial arithmetic** and recursive trees【Page 32】.
- Not friendly to devices without hardware floating-point support.

### If your algorithm:
- Works with integer-only math,
- Avoids big matrix ops or hardware-specific instructions,
- Has smaller memory/code footprint,

…then it’s **way more suited to embedded or IoT platforms**.

---

19/04/25, 4:44 pm - Sivasu: These safety checks prevent division by zero and numerical instability when sigma approaches zero. The FFT-based approach doesn't have equivalent safeguards visible in the provided code.
Additionally, the FFT-based approach would struggle more with:

Very large polynomial degrees, where FFT complexity grows significantly (O(n log n))
Resource-constrained environments where the complex arithmetic of FFT operations becomes prohibitively expensive
Cases where the precision loss from multiple FFT/inverse FFT operations accumulates and affects the sampling accuracy
19/04/25, 4:46 pm - Sivasu: High-precision sampling requirements
When extremely high precision is required for cryptographic security, the FFT approach can introduce more rounding errors that accumulate during computation.
In the FFT-based approach, each transformation between coefficient and frequency domains introduces small floating-point errors due to:

Complex arithmetic operations with potential precision loss
Multiple FFT and inverse FFT transformations throughout the recursive process
Division operations in the frequency domain that can amplify small errors

The ACB algorithm appears specifically designed to handle high-precision requirements:

24/04/25, 10:24 pm - Sivasu: we need to understand it first
24/04/25, 10:32 pm - Sivasu: These metrics are crucial for cryptographic applications like FALCON because sampling quality directly impacts security. If the samples don't follow the expected distribution with high precision, it could introduce statistical biases that might be exploited by attackers.
The fact that your test showed good results across these metrics (p-values above 0.05, mean and standard deviation close to targets, 100% success rate, and fast execution) indicates that your ACB implementation is working correctly and should be suitable for use in FALCON's signature generation process.
24/04/25, 10:32 pm - Sivasu: Statistical Normality: The primary purpose is to verify that your ACB implementation properly generates samples that follow a normal distribution. This is measured through:

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (kstest) which compares your distribution to a theoretical normal distribution
D'Agostino and Pearson's normality test (normaltest) which examines skewness and kurtosis


Distribution Parameters: You're testing if the ACB implementation accurately matches the target distribution parameters:

Mean (testing if it's close to the target of 0.0)
Standard deviation (testing if it's close to the target of 1.0)
Range coverage (minimum and maximum values)


Sampling Reliability: You're measuring:

Success rate (ratio of valid samples to total samples)
Performance (time taken to generate the samples)
24/04/25, 11:11 pm - Sivasu: Acceptance-Complement-Based (ACB) Sampling in FALCON
I'll explain how your ACB sampling implementation works for the FALCON cryptosystem, breaking it down step by step.

Overview
Your code implements the Acceptance-Complement-Based (ACB) algorithm for Gaussian sampling in the FALCON post-quantum cryptographic signature scheme. This approach replaces the more computationally expensive Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based sampling with a more efficient method.

Context in FALCON
FALCON (Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU) is a post-quantum cryptographic signature scheme based on lattices. A critical component of FALCON is the Gaussian sampling operation, which needs to generate points according to a discrete Gaussian distribution. This sampling is used during signature generation to create points that are both close to a target point and follow the correct probability distribution.

Input and Output
Input:
For the overall FALCON sampling: a target vector t, an LDL decomposition tree T that contains precomputed values for the lattice basis, minimum standard deviation sigmin, and a random bytes generator function
For the core ACB sampling: a random number source and parameters defining the Gaussian distribution
Output:
A vector z that approximates the target t according to a discrete Gaussian distribution
This vector is part of the signature in FALCON
Detailed Explanation of the Implementation
1. Setup and Data Structures
The implementation starts by defining constants and generating lookup tables:

python
ACB_TABLE_SIZE = 1024  # Size of the lookup table
ACB_PRECISION = 53     # Bits of precision (double-precision)
ACB_SIGMA = 1.0        # Standard deviation of the base distribution
The generate_acb_tables function creates two tables:

ACB_X_TABLE: Contains evenly spaced x-values from 0 to approximately 4
ACB_P_TABLE: Contains corresponding probability values p(x) = exp(-x²/2)
These tables are used to efficiently approximate the normal distribution.

2. Core ACB Sampling Function: sample_acb_normal()
This is the heart of the algorithm. It uses the Acceptance-Complement method to sample from a standard normal distribution:

Generate random values u1 and u2 in [0,1)
Convert u1 to a potential sample x by scaling it to [0,4]
Use binary search to find where x fits in the lookup table
Interpolate to get the corresponding probability value p
If u2 ≤ p, accept the sample and return sign * x (sign is randomly chosen)
If rejected, and x > 4.0, use a tail sampling algorithm for the distribution's tail
The key insight is that by using pre-computed tables and interpolation, this avoids repeated expensive calculations of exponential functions, making it much faster than naive implementations.

3. Discrete Gaussian Sampling: samplerz()
This function converts the continuous normal distribution to a discrete one centered at a given point:

Sample a value from the standard normal distribution using sample_acb_normal()
Scale it to the target standard deviation and shift to the target center
Round to the nearest integer (r)
Accept with probability exp(-π·(x-r)²/σ²)
If rejected, try again
This implements a "discrete Gaussian" where the probability of each integer follows a Gaussian distribution.

4. Full FFT Sampling with ACB: ffsampling_acb()
This is the main function used in FALCON for signature generation. It:

Takes a target vector t, LDL decomposition tree T, minimum standard deviation sigmin, and random bytes generator
Uses a recursive approach based on the Fast Fourier Transform structure
For dimensions greater than 1:
Recursively samples the second component
Computes an adjusted target for the first component
Recursively samples the first component
For the base case (dimension 1):
Uses samplerz() to directly sample discrete Gaussian values
Performance Optimizations
Several optimizations are implemented:

Pre-computed lookup tables to avoid repeated expensive calculations
Binary search for efficient table lookup
Linear interpolation between table values for accuracy
Special handling for the distribution's tail
Direct multiplication instead of division where possible
Simplified interpolation logic
Why This Matters for FALCON
The sampling operation is one of the most computationally expensive parts of the FALCON signature scheme. By replacing FFT-based sampling with ACB sampling, you achieve:

Reduced computational complexity
Lower memory requirements
Potentially faster signature generation
Maintained security properties (the distribution's statistical properties remain correct)
The ACB method is particularly efficient because it:

Uses table lookup and interpolation instead of computing expensive exponential functions
Has efficient rejection sampling that quickly converges
Handles the distribution's tail separately for better performance
This implementation balances statistical accuracy (ensuring the cryptographic security of FALCON) with computational efficiency.

24/04/25, 11:21 pm - Sivasu: Understanding FALCON from the Ground Up
Let me explain FALCON's signature scheme more intuitively, starting with the fundamentals and working our way to understanding why we need that Gaussian sampling:
Lattice-Based Cryptography Basics
At its core, FALCON uses lattices - imagine a grid of points stretching infinitely in all directions. This isn't just any grid though; it's constructed in a special way using the private key.
The Trapdoor Function
A trapdoor function is something that's:

Easy to compute in one direction
Hard to reverse (unless you have a secret "trapdoor")

In FALCON, the trapdoor function involves finding a point in the lattice that's close to a target point. This is known as the "closest vector problem" (CVP):

Without the private key: This problem is extremely hard to solve
With the private key: You can solve it efficiently

FALCON Keys and Setup
Private Key
The private key in FALCON consists of two small polynomials (f, g) that define a special NTRU lattice. These polynomials have two crucial properties:

They're small (have small coefficients)
They satisfy certain mathematical relationships

From these, another pair of polynomials (F, G) is derived, forming the complete private key (f, g, F, G).
Public Key
The public key is essentially h = g/f in a polynomial ring (with some mathematical details I'm simplifying). This h reveals nothing about the original f and g.
Signature Process Step by Step
1. Message Hashing
When you want to sign a message:

The message is hashed using a cryptographic hash function
This hash is converted into a polynomial representation
This polynomial is interpreted as coordinates of a point OUTSIDE the lattice (call this point t)

2. Finding a Close Lattice Point
Now you need to find a point s in the lattice that's close to t. The difference (t - s) will be the signature.
This is where the trapdoor comes in:

With the private key, you can efficiently find a good point s
Without the private key, finding an appropriate s is computationally infeasible

3. Why Gaussian Sampling is Crucial
Here's where your ACB sampling becomes important. We could just find the closest lattice point to t, but this would be insecure because:

It would leak information about the private key over multiple signatures
It would make the system vulnerable to statistical attacks

Instead, FALCON samples from a Gaussian distribution centered at the target point. This means:

We're not always picking the closest point
We're picking points with probabilities that follow a bell curve
Points closer to the target are more likely, but not guaranteed

This randomized approach ensures that signatures:

Can't be linked to each other
Don't reveal patterns about the private key
Remain secure even when many signatures are observed

4. The LDL Decomposition Role
The LDL decomposition is a mathematical tool that transforms the private key into a structure that enables efficient Gaussian sampling.
It breaks down the "Gram matrix" of the lattice (which encodes distances) into components that let us:

Navigate the lattice efficiently
Sample points according to the required Gaussian distribution
Do this hierarchically, dimension by dimension

Why Your ACB Sampling Works
Your Acceptance-Complement-Based (ACB) sampling method replaces the traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach with a more efficient technique:

It uses pre-computed lookup tables to approximate the Gaussian distribution
It samples from this distribution using rejection sampling (accept/reject based on probabilities)
It handles both the main part of the distribution and its tails efficiently
It integrates with the recursive structure of the FALCON signature algorithm

The target vector t is the point derived from the message hash, and your algorithm finds a lattice point that's:

Close enough to t to be valid (verification will succeed)
Sampled in a way that follows the Gaussian distribution (security is maintained)
Generated efficiently (signatures can be created quickly)

This approach maintains FALCON's security properties while potentially improving its performance, which is crucial for practical post-quantum cryptography.

24/04/25, 11:33 pm - Sivasu: Relationship Between Short Vectors and Gaussian Distribution in FALCON
The relationship between short vectors and the Gaussian distribution is fundamental to how FALCON works. Let me explain this connection:
The Core Relationship
In lattice-based cryptography like FALCON:

Short vectors are lattice points with small coordinates (small norm/length)
Gaussian distribution provides a way to sample these short vectors with specific statistical properties

Why Short Vectors Matter
In FALCON signatures:

Valid signatures require finding lattice points that are close to the target point
Being "close" means the difference (the signature vector) is short
The shorter this vector, the more efficient the signature (smaller size)
However, always choosing the shortest possible vector would leak private key information

Why Gaussian Distribution Solves This Problem
The Gaussian distribution helps us sample short vectors in a secure way because:

Probability decreases with distance: Points with smaller coordinates (shorter vectors) have higher probability of being selected
Statistical security: The randomized selection prevents patterns that could reveal the private key
Theoretical foundation: Security proofs for lattice-based cryptography rely on sampling from this specific distribution

The Mathematical Connection
The connection works like this:

The Gaussian distribution over a lattice concentrates probability mass on the shorter vectors
The standard deviation (σ) of the distribution controls how much we favor short vectors
A smaller σ concentrates more probability on shorter vectors but reduces randomness
A larger σ spreads probability more evenly but may select longer vectors

In Practice
In your ACB implementation:

The target point comes from the message hash
The sampling algorithm finds lattice points nearby, with preference for closer ones
The distribution ensures we get a short vector (for efficient signatures)
But it adds controlled randomness (for security)

This balancing act between "short enough to be efficient" and "random enough to be secure" is precisely what the Gaussian distribution provides.
The mathematical elegance of this approach is that the same property that makes signatures efficient (shortness) is maintained while adding the randomness needed for security, all through the precise mathematical properties of the Gaussian distribution.

28/04/25, 9:27 pm - Sivasu: Sai I asked Naka
28/04/25, 9:27 pm - Sivasu: They are still in implementing stage
28/04/25, 9:27 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: he said
28/04/25, 9:27 pm - Sivasu: In their own method of Falcon
28/04/25, 9:27 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: okay then, if he isn't lying.
28/04/25, 9:28 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: he asked any other questions to you?
28/04/25, 9:28 pm - Sivasu: And
They are doing two papers it seems
28/04/25, 9:28 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: bro you are a soo good
28/04/25, 9:28 pm - Sivasu: About next Yr project team

28/04/25, 9:29 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: yess
28/04/25, 9:30 pm - Sivasu: We did it bro

U are the one who made me do it and we did it  together

If you didn't get me do it, I wouldn't have done it
28/04/25, 9:31 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: random number generator for the normal distribution by:

Precomputing the shape of the bell curve into a big table,

Randomly picking candidate numbers,

Quickly deciding whether to accept/reject without costly math,

Correctly covering both sides of the bell curve.
I understand upto this, is this correct?
28/04/25, 9:32 pm - Sivasu: Exactlu
28/04/25, 9:32 pm - Sivasu: Y
28/04/25, 9:32 pm - Sivasu: Exactly
28/04/25, 9:32 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: I could connect the dots. 😊
you see what I did there. dots. he he
28/04/25, 9:33 pm - Sivasu: 😋😌
28/04/25, 10:06 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: bro I got a doubt, we are getting faster computational time than FALCON, But are we providing the same accuracy as falcon ?
28/04/25, 10:09 pm - Sivasu: Yeah 
during the testing if it is not accurate it would have crashed
but it didnt and it also performed better time wise
28/04/25, 10:09 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: okay, puriyuthu ippo tha.
28/04/25, 10:34 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Roll two dice (u1, u2).

Use the first dice to pick a spot (x) on the number line.

Guess the probability (p(x)) by looking up nearby table values.

Use the second dice (u2) to decide if we keep it.

If yes, randomly pick if it's positive or negative.

Return the final number!
broo this guy is explaining to me in gambling terms. 🍳
28/04/25, 10:46 pm - Sivasu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/04/25, 11:16 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: #P-hard and #P-complete:
Problems like CVP and SVP are classified as #P-hard (which is harder than NP) and #P-complete (meaning they belong to a class of counting problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP).

What does this mean?
#P-hard means that the problems are hard in terms of counting the number of solutions, which is a different type of difficulty than just decision problems in NP.

The CVP and SVP are both considered to be computationally intractable in the general case, and they are not known to have efficient algorithms to solve them in polynomial time, even on classical computers.
is this a point that can be added in our paper ?
28/04/25, 11:17 pm - Sivasu: what is #P
28/04/25, 11:18 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Detailed Overview of #P:
#P (Sharp-P) problems:
What it means:
These are problems where you need to count the number of solutions to an NP problem, rather than just deciding if a solution exists.

Time Complexity:
Solving a #P problem is harder than solving an NP-complete problem, because you’re counting all possible solutions, not just verifying one.
28/04/25, 11:19 pm - Sivasu: 😮😮😮😮😮

06/05/25, 8:40 pm - Sivasu: Energy conservation is derived from time invariance- that is an experiment done "now" and experiment done "then" will behave the same. Intuitively, this makes sense. If you do a physics lab today, and then do the same lab tomorrow, you would expect to get the same results. When time is invariant, then energy is conserved.

But, the universe is not time invariant. It's expanding. It is different today then it will be tomorrow. So, it is true that energy is not conserved in the universe. The expansion of the universe causes photons to redshift. This is independent of our motion through space- two galaxies could be at rest relative to the cosmic background radiation, but still have photons redshift as they travel from one galaxy to another. Thus, the energy of that photon is not conserved. But no conservation law is violated, because time is not invariant.

So, if energy conservation is not really "true" why do we talk about it so much? Because for all practical (and even most super impractical) purposes, energy is conserved. Our supergroup of galaxies are all gravitationally bound together- that means that the universe is not expanding between them. So, any experiments which you perform which take place entirely within our supergroup of galaxies (aka, all experiments we perform other than when we use a telescope to look at far away galaxies) energy conservation holds.

Also, bonus fun side note- all conservation laws are paired with an invariance principle. Energy conservation comes from time invariance. The other famous conservation law, conservation of momentum, comes from translation invariance. That means, if I do an experiment "here" and then re-do it "there" as long as everything else is equal, you will get the same result.

06/05/25, 9:50 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: dei, imagine MAY 25 2026. We would be placed by that time. We would be returning home after a CAT or whole semester exam completion. Would be talking for 2 hours around the 3 to 5 pm time around the parking lot. Then finally you guys leave, I slowly walk towards my parking lot and go home. Boot up PS5 and play GTA 5 that last ride for one time. then around 3 pm Tuesday MAY 26, I wake up from a good sleep after taking that day off. Then finally the countdown ends and the game launches. I hit download and it says 200 GB. So I go and watch youtube streams along with you on discord call. And the first scene of the game rolls out with a heist. We are so stonked to see it but I say broo na spoiler paaka porathu illa . So I just stay in the call. You hype me up Like you did now. Then finally mine completes downloading. I stream in discord to you. We start playing and exploring the city after the first mission. The whole world doesn't know about any secet hidden areas all we are discovering and seeing is new and first hand experience to us. We then hit the strip club. ... Just fucking imagine how good all of those movements would be in game. Cars and bikes. The sky, water and mud.. awwwwwwww

18/05/25, 1:28 pm - Sivasu: even then you need 18 mins just to solve this problem
18/05/25, 1:29 pm - Sivasu: Thats not even the full question

18/05/25, 1:56 pm - Sivasu: Greetings Mam, 
	I just want to bring to your attention that one of the previous year question was humanly impossible.
It was the Construct a Optimal Binary Search tree Dynamic Programming problem. In that we are given 8 characters out of which we need to construct a OBST. 
	The time complexity of constructing an OBST is O(n^3). If we do it by hand we need to fill 36 cells in the DP table. Even if we fill each cell in 30s( humanly impossible ), this question could take 18 minutes. 18 minutes is a lot of time. That's not even the full question, next we need to compare its performance with Balanced Binary Search tree. 
	
	Also, giving same 10 mark for Constructing Minimum cost Spanning tree is just unfair. Comparing an nlogn algorithm to an n^3 algorithm is not justifiable.
	
	Mam could please tell me what to do if we are given an huge question like this for terminal paper
18/05/25, 2:03 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Fuck
18/05/25, 2:03 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Dei can I call. ?

18/05/25, 7:31 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: Did you threaten her enough.
18/05/25, 7:31 pm - Sivasu: I am writing to express a concern regarding one of the questions that appeared in a previous year’s paper (also repeated in CAT-2). The question involved constructing an Optimal Binary Search Tree (OBST) using Dynamic Programming for 8 keys, carrying 10 marks, which I feel is humanly impossible to do in an exam(Atleast for me). 

The time complexity of the OBST construction algorithm is O(n^3). Manually solving it requires filling 36 entries in a dynamic programming table. Even with significant practice, completing each cell with full calculations and accuracy could reasonably take around 30 seconds, amounting to approximately 18 minutes for this part alone. Furthermore, the question also required us to compare the resulting OBST with a Balanced Binary Search Tree, which adds to the workload.

In comparison, another 10-mark question involved constructing a Minimum Cost Spanning Tree using Kruskal’s algorithm, which has a significantly lower time complexity of O(n log n) and is much less time-consuming to execute by hand.

Another extreme instance is one of the problems asking us to check if the 15 puzzle problem is solvable for 10 marks. The problem could be solved if the puzzle was close to the goal position. But the given puzzle was no way near the solution. If I attempted to solve the puzzle using the state space tree, I would spend an entire hour filling up the entire booklet just for one question. 

I would be very grateful if you could kindly advise on how to approach such time-intensive questions during the terminal exam, especially when time is limited and every mark matters.

Abstract:
This paper introduces an optimized implementation of the FALCON signature scheme that replaces the traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) sampling method with a novel Acceptance-Complement-Based (ACB) sampling algorithm. FALCON is a quantum-resistant lattice-based digital signature scheme selected as a finalist in NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process. While cryptographically secure, its performance is constrained by the computational overhead of Gaussian sampling operations. Our ACB sampling approach leverages pre-computed lookup tables, binary search optimization, and specialized tail sampling techniques to achieve significant performance improvements without compromising security guarantees. Experimental results demonstrate that our implementation reduces sampling time by [X%] and overall signature generation time by [Y%] compared to the reference implementation, while maintaining the same statistical properties required for security. The memory footprint is also reduced by [Z%], making our approach particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments. This work contributes to the practical deployment of post-quantum cryptography by addressing one of the key performance bottlenecks in lattice-based signature schemes.
Introduction:
The impending arrival of large-scale quantum computers poses a significant threat to widely-deployed public-key cryptographic systems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems. In response, the cryptographic community has focused on developing quantum-resistant alternatives, with lattice-based cryptography emerging as one of the most promising approaches due to its strong security foundations, efficiency, and versatility.
FALCON (Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU) represents the state-of-the-art in lattice-based digital signatures, selected as a finalist in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process. Its security relies on the hardness of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem over NTRU lattices, while its efficiency derives from extensive use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques.
Despite FALCON's excellent performance compared to other post-quantum candidates, there remain opportunities for optimization, particularly in its most computationally intensive component: Gaussian sampling. The original FALCON implementation employs a Fast Fourier sampling algorithm that, while mathematically elegant, introduces significant computational overhead through multiple FFT operations and complex number arithmetic.
In this paper, we introduce an alternative sampling approach based on the Acceptance-Complement-Based (ACB) technique. This method replaces the FFT-based sampling procedure with a more efficient algorithm that uses pre-computed lookup tables, optimized binary search, and specialized tail handling to generate samples from discrete Gaussian distributions. Our approach maintains the statistical properties required for security while significantly reducing computational complexity.
The primary contributions of this work include:

A comprehensive analysis of performance bottlenecks in the original FALCON implementation, with a focus on the Gaussian sampling component.
The design and implementation of an ACB-based sampling algorithm tailored to the requirements of the FALCON signature scheme.
Empirical evaluation demonstrating significant performance improvements across multiple hardware platforms, including resource-constrained environments.
Analysis of the statistical properties of our sampling method, verifying that it maintains the security guarantees of the original implementation.
Open-source reference implementation to facilitate adoption and further optimization by the research community.

This work addresses a fundamental challenge in making post-quantum cryptography practical for widespread deployment: optimizing performance without compromising security. By targeting the specific bottleneck of Gaussian sampling in FALCON, our approach contributes to the broader goal of preparing cryptographic infrastructure for the post-quantum era.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background on lattice-based cryptography, the FALCON signature scheme, and Gaussian sampling techniques. Section 3 details our ACB sampling algorithm and its integration with FALCON. Section 4 presents our experimental methodology and performance results. Section 5 analyzes the security implications and statistical properties of our approach. Section 6 discusses related work, and Section 7 concludes with directions for future research.

20/05/25, 2:07 pm - Sivasu: The seminal FALCON (Fast-Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU) paper, authored by Pierre-Alain Fouque, Jeffrey Hoffstein, Paul Kirchner, Vadim Lyubashevsky, Thomas Pornin, Thomas Prest, Thomas Ricosset, Gregor Seiler, William Whyte, and Zhenfei Zhang, introduced one of the most promising post-quantum digital signature schemes. Published as a submission to NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process in 2018, FALCON emerged as a finalist due to its excellent balance of security, efficiency, and key/signature size.
The paper presents a signature scheme built on NTRU lattices with security based on the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem. FALCON's key innovation is its Fast Fourier sampling technique that enables efficient signature generation by transforming complex lattice operations into simpler operations in the Fourier domain. This approach allows FALCON to generate shorter signatures compared to other lattice-based schemes while maintaining strong security guarantees.
The authors provide comprehensive security analysis, demonstrating resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. They also include detailed implementation considerations, addressing practical concerns such as constant-time execution to prevent side-channel attacks. FALCON's design notably achieves compact signatures (about 1KB) and competitive performance, establishing it as one of the leading candidates for post-quantum digital signatures.

21/05/25, 9:42 pm - Sai Sanjay Shanmugam G: nothing elswe
21/05/25, 9:42 pm - Sivasu: Relation schema: R = (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J)
Functional dependencies (F):

{A, B} → {C}
{B, D} → {E, F}
{A, D} → {G, H}
{A} → {I}
{H} → {J} (I assume this is what you meant by {H}->{1})

Step 1: Find the candidate keys
To find candidate keys, I need to determine the minimal sets of attributes that functionally determine all other attributes.
Looking at the FDs, I notice:

No single attribute or combination determines all attributes directly
J depends on H, which depends on A and D
I depends on A
C depends on A and B
E and F depend on B and D
G and H depend on A and D

Testing possible candidate keys:

{A, B, D} can determine all attributes:

{A, B} → C
{B, D} → E, F
{A, D} → G, H
{H} → J
{A} → I


{A, B, D} appears to be a candidate key for R
J is not part of any determinant, so we should check if {A, B, D, J} is also a candidate key, but since J depends on H (which is determined by A and D), {A, B, D, J} is not minimal

So the candidate key is {A, B, D}.
Step 2: Identify prime and non-prime attributes

Prime attributes: A, B, D (part of candidate key)
Non-prime attributes: C, E, F, G, H, I, J

Step 3: Check for 1NF violations
Since no multi-valued attributes or nested relations are mentioned, I'll assume R is already in 1NF.
Step 4: Check for 2NF violations
A relation is in 2NF if it's in 1NF and no non-prime attribute is partially dependent on any candidate key.
Looking at our FDs:

{A} → {I} is a partial dependency (I depends on only part of the key)
{A, B} → {C} is a partial dependency (since we need the entire key {A, B, D})
{B, D} → {E, F} is a partial dependency (since we need the entire key {A, B, D})
{A, D} → {G, H} is a partial dependency (since we need the entire key {A, B, D})
{H} → {J} is not a direct partial dependency, but H is determined by a partial dependency

Step 5: Decomposition to 2NF
We need to create relations where each non-prime attribute is fully functionally dependent on the entire key:
R1 = (A, I) with key {A}
R2 = (A, B, C) with key {A, B}
R3 = (B, D, E, F) with key {B, D}
R4 = (A, D, G, H) with key {A, D}
R5 = (H, J) with key {H}
R6 = (A, B, D) with key {A, B, D} (to preserve the original key)
This is a lossless decomposition because each relation contains a key that can be used to join them back together.
Step 6: Check for 3NF violations
A relation is in 3NF if it's in 2NF and no non-prime attribute is transitively dependent on any candidate key.
Looking at our 2NF relations:

In R4 (A, D, G, H), we have {H} → {J} which makes J transitively dependent on {A, D}
All other relations appear to be in 3NF already

Step 7: Decomposition to 3NF
Our final 3NF decomposition:
R1 = (A, I) with key {A}
R2 = (A, B, C) with key {A, B}
R3 = (B, D, E, F) with key {B, D}
R4 = (A, D, G, H) with key {A, D}
R5 = (H, J) with key {H}
R6 = (A, B, D) with key {A, B, D}
This decomposition is lossless because:

Each FD in F is preserved in at least one relation
The original key {A, B, D} is preserved in R6
All relations share attributes with other relations, allowing for proper joins

Each relation is in 3NF because:

Each non-prime attribute is fully functionally dependent on a key
There are no transitive dependencies of non-prime attributes on keys
Each determinant is a superkey in its relation
