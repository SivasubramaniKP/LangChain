Okay, here's how you should plan your day in Madurai on June 12, 2025, based on the weather report:

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Heat & Humidity:** The "feels like" temperature is significantly higher than the actual temperature, especially in the morning.  The average humidity is also high.
*   **High Chance of Rain:** An 85% chance of rain means you should definitely be prepared for it.
*   **Stronger Winds:** Expect moderate to strong winds, especially during the afternoon.
*   **Very High UV Index (Morning):** Sun protection is crucial in the morning.

**Here's a suggested plan:**

*   **Morning (Until Noon):**
    *   **Limit Outdoor Activities:** Due to the high "feels like" temperature and very high UV index, try to minimize prolonged exposure to the sun.
    *   **Sun Protection is a Must:** If you must be outside, wear sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher), a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses. Seek shade whenever possible.
    *   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and avoid heatstroke.
    *   **Plan Indoor Activities:** Consider indoor activities like visiting a museum, shopping, or relaxing at home.

*   **Afternoon (Noon - 6 PM):**
    *   **Prepare for Rain:** Carry an umbrella or raincoat, as there's a high probability of patchy rain.
    *   **Wind Considerations:** Be aware of the stronger winds, especially if you're walking or cycling.
    *   **Continue Hydrating:** Even with the rain, it will likely still be humid, so keep drinking water.
    *   **Check for Updates:** Keep an eye on local weather updates, as the timing and intensity of the rain could change.

*   **Evening/Night (6 PM Onward):**
    *   **Potential for Lingering Showers:** The chance of rain decreases, but there's still a possibility of patchy rain nearby.
    *   **Enjoy the Full Moon:** The moon will be nearly full and very bright, so it could be a nice evening for a walk (if the rain stays away).
    *   **Cooler Temperatures:** Temperatures will gradually decrease, making it more comfortable to be outside.

**Specific Recommendations:**

*   **Outdoor Activities:** If you *must* be outdoors, the late afternoon or early evening might be the best time, but be prepared for rain.
*   **Travel:** Be cautious when driving, especially if there's heavy rain and reduced visibility.
*   **Clothing:** Wear light, breathable clothing to help you stay cool.
*   **Vulnerable Individuals:**  The elderly, young children, and people with chronic health conditions should be extra careful to avoid heat-related illnesses.

**In short: Stay cool, stay hydrated, protect yourself from the sun (especially in the morning), and be prepared for rain throughout the day.**
