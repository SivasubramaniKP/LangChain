Since there\\'s a chance of rain, consider clothing that dries quickly.\\n*   **Activities:** If you have outdoor plans, be flexible. Carry an umbrella or raincoat.  If possible, schedule outdoor activities for the morning when the \"feels like\" temperature isn\\'t at its peak.\\n*   **Sun Protection:** Even with partly cloudy conditions, apply sunscreen, especially if you\\'ll be outside during the late morning as the UV index will be moderate. Wear sunglasses and a hat.\\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the morning to stay hydrated, especially before the \"feels like\" temperature rises.\\n\\n**Afternoon (Noon to Sunset):**\\n\\n*   **Heat Precautions:** This is the hottest part of the day.
