Web Application\\n\\nA web application is software that runs on a web server and is accessed via a browser. It typically uses:\\n\\nFrontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (user interface)\\n\\nBackend: Java, PHP, Python, etc. (logic + database communication)\\n\\nDatabase: Stores user and app data (MySQL, Oracle, etc.)\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)\\n\\nJDBC is a Java API used to connect and execute queries with databases.\\n\\nDriverManager is used to get a connection.\\n\\nPreparedStatement is used to execute SQL safely and efficiently.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n4. Connection\\n\\nA Connection object in JDBC represents a session with the database. It is used to:\\n\\nExecute SQL queries.\\n\\nManage transactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n5. Database\\n\\nA structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. In your case:\\n\\nMySQL is the RDBMS used.\\n\\nYou create tables for users and questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n6. Form (HTML)\\n\\nAn HTML form collects user input. It sends data to a server via:\\n\\nmethod=\"get\" or method=\"post\"\\n\\naction=\"Register\" sends data to a servlet with URL mapping /Register.\\n\\n\\n\\n---'),\n",

Primary Key\\n\\nA unique identifier for a record in a table. Example: username in the users table.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n9. Foreign Key\\n\\nA column that refers to the primary key of another table. Example: username in the questions table refers to username in the users table.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n10.

It is highly scalable and ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.\\n\\n### 2. **MongoDB**  \\nMongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Each record is a document with key-value pairs.\\n\\n### 3. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**  \\nThese commands define the structure of the database, such as creating collections (equivalent to tables in RDBMS).\\n\\n> 📌 Example:\\n```js\\ndb.createCollection(\"users\");\\n```\\n\\n### 4. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**  \\nThese commands are used to insert, update, or delete the data in collections.\\n\\n> 📌 Example:\\n```js\\ndb.users.insertOne({\\n  uid: 1,\\n  username: \"codeMaster99\",\\n  email: \"codemaster99@example.com\",\\n  reputation: 1200\\n});\\n```'),\n",

In that we are given 8 characters out of which we need to construct a OBST. \\n\\tThe time complexity of constructing an OBST is O(n^3). If we do it by hand we need to fill 36 cells in the DP table. Even if we fill each cell in 30s( humanly impossible ), this question could take 18 minutes. 18 minutes is a lot of time. That's not even the full question, next we need to compare its performance with Balanced Binary Search tree. \\n\\t\\n\\tAlso, giving same 10 mark for Constructing Minimum cost Spanning tree is just unfair.

Furthermore, the question also required us to compare the resulting OBST with a Balanced Binary Search Tree, which adds to the workload.\\n\\nIn comparison, another 10-mark question involved constructing a Minimum Cost Spanning Tree using Kruskal’s algorithm, which has a significantly lower time complexity of O(n log n) and is much less time-consuming to execute by hand.'),\n",
