       "AIMessage(content='Okay, let\\'s break down how to learn Git effectively. I\\'ll provide a structured approach, covering the core concepts, essential commands, and practical tips.\\n\\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\\n\\n*   **What is Git?** Git is a distributed version control system.  It tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to specific versions, collaborate with others, and manage different branches of your project.\\n*   **Repository (Repo):**  A repository is the main container for your project, storing all the files, history, and metadata.  It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).\\n*   **Commit:** A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It includes the changes you\\'ve made since the last commit, along with a message describing those changes.  Commits are the building blocks of your project\\'s history.\\n*   **Branch:** A branch is a separate line of development. It allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase (usually the `main` or `master` branch).  You can later merge branches back together.\\n*   **Staging Area (Index):** The staging area is an intermediate area where you prepare changes to be included in your next commit.  You add specific files or changes to the staging area before committing.\\n*   **Working Directory:** This is the directory on your computer where you are actively working on your project files.\\n*   **Remote:** A remote is a pointer to another repository, usually on a server.  This allows you to collaborate with others, back up your code, and share your project.\\n\\n**2. Essential Git Commands (The Foundation)**\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of the most important commands, grouped by function:\\n\\n*   **Initialization & Setup:**\\n\\n    *   `git init`:  Creates a new Git repository in the current directory.  Use this to start tracking an existing project.\\n    *   `git clone <repository_url>`:  Downloads a copy of a remote repository to your local machine.  Use this to get a project from GitHub, GitLab, etc.\\n    *   `git config`:  Configures Git settings, such as your username and email.  Important for attributing your commits correctly.  Example: `git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"`\\n\\n*   **Basic Workflow (Making Changes):**\\n\\n    *   `git status`:  Shows the current status of your working directory and staging area.  Tells you which files have been modified, staged, or are untracked.  Use this *constantly*.\\n    *   `git add <file>`:  Adds a file to the staging area.  Use `git add .` to add all modified and untracked files in the current directory (be careful with this!).\\n    *   `git commit -m \"Your commit message\"`:  Creates a new commit with the changes in the staging area.  *Always* write clear and concise commit messages.  Good messages are crucial for understanding the history of your project.\\n    *   `git rm <file>`:  Removes a file from your working directory and staging area.\\n    *   `git mv <old_name> <new_name>`:  Renames a file.\\n\\n*   **Branching & Merging:**\\n\\n    *   `git branch`:  Lists all local branches.\\n    *   `git branch <branch_name>`:  Creates a new branch.\\n    *   `git checkout <branch_name>`:  Switches to the specified branch.\\n    *   `git checkout -b <branch_name>`: Creates a new branch and switches to it.\\n    *   `git merge <branch_name>`:  Merges the specified branch into the current branch.  This combines the changes from the other branch into your current work.\\n    *   `git branch -d <branch_name>`:  Deletes a branch (after it has been merged).\\n    *   `git branch -D <branch_name>`:  Force deletes a branch (even if it hasn\\'t been merged – use with caution!).\\n\\n*   **Remote Repositories (Collaboration):**\\n\\n    *   `git remote add origin <repository_url>`:  Adds a remote repository named \"origin\" (this is a common convention).\\n    *   `git remote -v`: Lists the remote repositories and their URLs.\\n    *   `git fetch`:  Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branches.\\n    *   `git pull`:  Downloads changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch.  This is essentially `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.\\n    *   `git push`:  Uploads your local commits to a remote repository.\\n\\n*   **Inspecting History:**\\n\\n    *   `git log`:  Shows the commit history.  Use `git log --oneline` for a more compact view.  `git log --graph` is also very helpful.\\n    *   `git diff`:  Shows the differences between files, commits, or branches.\\n    *   `git show <commit_hash>`:  Shows the details of a specific commit.\\n    *   `git blame <file>`:  Shows who last modified each line of a file.\\n\\n*   **Undoing Changes:**\\n\\n    *   `git checkout -- <file>`:  Discards changes to a file in your working directory (reverts to the last committed version).  *This is a destructive operation!*\\n    *   `git reset HEAD <file>`:  Removes a file from the staging area.\\n    *   `git revert <commit_hash>`:  Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit.  This is a safe way to undo changes because it preserves the history.\\n    *   `git reset --hard <commit_hash>`:  Resets your branch to a specific commit, discarding all changes after that commit.  *This is a very destructive operation!  Use with extreme caution!*\\n\\n**3. A Practical Learning Approach**\\n\\n1.  **Start with a Simple Project:** Create a small project (e.g., a simple text file, a basic HTML page, a small Python script). The goal is to have something to track with Git.\\n\\n2.  **Initialize a Repository:** Use `git init` to create a Git repository in your project\\'s directory.\\n\\n3.  **Make Changes, Stage, and Commit:**\\n    *   Edit your files.\\n    *   Use `git status` to see the changes.\\n    *   Use `git add` to stage the changes.\\n    *   Use `git commit -m \"Your message\"` to commit the changes.\\n\\n4.  **Explore the History:** Use `git log` to view the commit history.\\n\\n5.  **Branching and Merging:**\\n    *   Create a new branch using `git branch <branch_name>`.\\n    *   Switch to the new branch using `git checkout <branch_name>`.\\n    *   Make changes on the new branch and commit them.\\n    *   Switch back to the main branch using `git checkout main` (or `git checkout master`).\\n    *   Merge the new branch into the main branch using `git merge <branch_name>`.\\n    *   Resolve any merge conflicts (if they occur).\\n\\n6.  **Remote Repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket):**\\n    *   Create a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.\\n    *   Add the remote repository to your local repository using `git remote add origin <repository_url>`.\\n    *   Push your local commits to the remote repository using `git push -u origin main` (the `-u` flag sets up tracking so you can just use `git push` later).\\n    *   Make changes on your local machine, commit them, and push them to the remote repository.\\n    *   Have a friend (or create a second account) make changes to the remote repository and then pull those changes to your local machine using `git pull`.\\n\\n7.  **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The more you use Git, the more comfortable you\\'ll become.  Experiment with different commands and scenarios.\\n\\n**4. Recommended Resources**\\n\\n*   **Git Documentation:** The official Git documentation is comprehensive and accurate: [https://git-scm.com/doc](https://git-scm.com/doc)\\n*   **GitHub Learning Lab:** Interactive courses on Git and GitHub: [https://lab.github.com/](https://lab.github.com/)\\n*   **Atlassian Git Tutorial:** A well-structured tutorial with clear explanations and examples: [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)\\n*   **Learn Git Branching:** An interactive game that teaches Git branching concepts: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)\\n*   **Pro Git Book:** A free online book that covers Git in detail: [https://git-scm.com/book](https://git-scm.com/book)\\n*   **Codecademy\\'s Learn Git Course:** A hands-on, interactive course that covers the basics of Git and GitHub.\\n*   **Udemy/Coursera Git Courses:** Many paid courses are available that provide structured learning and hands-on exercises.\\n\\n**5. Tips for Success**\\n\\n*   **Commit Frequently:** Make small, logical commits with clear messages. This makes it easier to understand the history of your project and revert changes if necessary.\\n*   **Write Good Commit Messages:** Use the imperative mood (\"Add feature,\" not \"Added feature\"). Explain *why* you made the changes, not just *what* you changed.\\n*   **Use Branches:**  Don\\'t work directly on the `main` branch. Create branches for new features, bug fixes, and experiments.\\n*   **Practice on a Test Repository:**  Create a dummy repository to experiment with Git commands without fear of breaking anything.\\n*   **Use a Git GUI (Optional):**  Tools like GitKraken, Sourcetree, or GitHub Desktop can make Git easier to visualize and use, especially for beginners.  However, it\\'s important to understand the command-line commands first.\\n*   **Don\\'t Be Afraid to Ask for Help:**  If you get stuck, search online, consult the Git documentation, or ask a colleague for help.  The Git community is very active and supportive.\\n*   **Understand Merge Conflicts:**  Merge conflicts are inevitable when working with Git. Learn how to resolve them effectively.  Git will mark the conflicting sections in your files; you\\'ll need to manually edit the files to resolve the conflicts and then stage and commit the changes.\\n*   **Backup Regularly:** While Git *is* a backup system, it\\'s still a good idea to have a separate backup of your repository, especially if you\\'re working on important projects.\\n\\n**Example Workflow**\\n\\nLet\\'s say you\\'re working on a website:\\n\\n1.  **`git init`**:  Initialize a Git repository in your website\\'s directory.\\n2.  **Create `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`**: Add some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.\\n3.  **`git add .`**: Stage all the new files.\\n4.  **`git commit -m \"Initial commit: Basic website structure\"`**: Commit the changes.\\n5.  **`git branch feature/new-header`**: Create a new branch for adding a new header.\\n6.  **`git checkout feature/new-header`**: Switch to the new branch.\\n7.  **Edit `index.html` and `style.css`**: Add the new header to your website.\\n8.  **`git add .`**: Stage the changes.\\n9.  **`git commit -m \"Add new header to website\"`**: Commit the changes.\\n10. **`git checkout main`**: Switch back to the main branch.\\n11. **`git merge feature/new-header`**: Merge the `feature/new-header` branch into the main branch.\\n12. **`git branch -d feature/new-header`**: Delete the `feature/new-header` branch.\\n13. **`git push origin main`**: Push the changes to your remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).\\n\\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them**\\n\\n*   **Forgetting to Stage Changes:**  Always use `git add` to stage your changes before committing.  `git commit` only commits the changes that are in the staging area.\\n*   **Committing Large Changes:**  Break down large changes into smaller, more manageable commits.\\n*   **Committing Secrets:**  Never commit sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or private keys to your repository. Use environment variables or other secure methods to store this information.\\n*   **Force Pushing:**  Avoid using `git push --force` unless you know exactly what you\\'re doing.  It can overwrite the remote repository and cause problems for other collaborators.\\n*   **Ignoring `.gitignore`:** Use a `.gitignore` file to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git (e.g., temporary files, build artifacts, node_modules).\\n*   **Not Pulling Regularly:**  Pull changes from the remote repository regularly to stay up-to-date with the latest changes.  This helps to avoid merge conflicts.\\n\\nBy following this structured approach and practicing regularly, you\\'ll be well on your way to mastering Git. Good luck!

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.'),\n",

This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#'),\n",

The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n...

After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.'),\n",

This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#'),\n",
